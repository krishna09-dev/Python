'''Write a simple program that asks to enter two numbers and prints out their
sum and difference. Write comments to describe your code.'''

# Enter the first number
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Enter the second number
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Calculate the sum of the two numbers
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Calculate the difference of the two numbers
difference_result = num1 - num2

# Print the sum and difference
print("Sum:", sum_result)
print("Difference:", difference_result)
